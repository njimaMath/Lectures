                    <h3>1.1 Model of Simple Random Walk on \( \mathbb{Z}^d \)</h3>
                    <p>
                        A simple random walk (SRW) on the integer lattice \( \mathbb{Z}^d \) is a stochastic process describing a path that consists of a succession of random steps. At each step, the particle moves from its current position to one of its nearest neighbors with equal probability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Specifically, let \( \bm{X}_t \in \mathbb{Z}^d \) denote the position of the particle at time \( t \in \mathbb{N}_0 = \{0, 1, 2, \dots\} \). The particle starts at some initial position \( \bm{X}_0 \). At each time step \( t \ge 1 \), the particle moves from \( \bm{X}_{t-1} \) to \( \bm{X}_t \) by choosing one of the \( 2d \) neighboring lattice points with equal probability \( 1/(2d) \).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The transition probability, denoted by \( p(\bm{x}, \bm{y}) \), is the probability of moving from site \( \bm{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^d \) to site \( \bm{y} \in \mathbb{Z}^d \) in one step:
                    </p>
                    \[
                    p(\bm{x}, \bm{y}) = \Pbb(\bm{X}_t = \bm{y} \mid \bm{X}_{t-1} = \bm{x}) =
                    \begin{cases}
                    \frac{1}{2d} & \text{if } \|\bm{y} - \bm{x}\|_1 = 1, \\
                    0 & \text{otherwise},
                    \end{cases}
                    \]
                    <p>
                        where \( \|\bm{v}\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^d |v_i| \) is the L1 norm (or Manhattan distance) for a vector \( \bm{v} = (v_1, \dots, v_d) \in \mathbb{Z}^d \). A condition \( \|\bm{y} - \bm{x}\|_1 = 1 \) means that \( \bm{y} \) and \( \bm{x} \) differ by exactly 1 in one coordinate and are identical in all other coordinates; they are nearest neighbors on the lattice \( \mathbb{Z}^d \).

                    <p>
                        This process has the following properties:

                        <li><strong>Time Homogeneity:</strong> The transition probabilities \( p(\bm{x}, \bm{y}) \) do not depend on the time \( t \).</li>
                        <li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> The probability of moving from \( \bm{x} \) to \( \bm{y} \) is the same as moving from \( \bm{y} \) to \( \bm{x} \), i.e., \( p(\bm{x}, \bm{y}) = p(\bm{y}, \bm{x}) \).</li>

                        This famous result implies that a random walker in 1D or 2D space will eventually explore the entire space (in a certain sense) and keep returning to its starting point, whereas a walker in 3D or higher dimensions has a significant chance of escaping to infinity and never returning. This has amusing interpretations, like "A drunk man will find his way home, but a drunk bird may be lost forever." (Assuming the man walks in 2D and the bird flies in 3D).

                    <h3>2.3 Transition from Simple Random Walk to Brownian Motion</h3>
                    <p>
                    Brownian motion arises as a scaling limit of simple random walks. This is a manifestation of the Functional Central Limit Theorem (also known as Donsker's Theorem).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Consider a 1D SRW \( (S_n)_{n=0}^\infty \) starting at \( S_0 = 0 \), where \( S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i \) and \( \xi_i \) are independent random variables with \( \Pbb(\xi_i = +1) = \Pbb(\xi_i = -1) = 1/2 \). We want to construct a continuous-time process from this discrete walk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Let's speed up time by a factor of \( n \) and scale down space by a factor of \( \sqrt{n} \). Define a continuous-time process \( (W_t^{(n)})_{t \ge 0} \) by piecewise constant interpolation:
                    </p>
                    \[
                    W_t^{(n)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} S_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}.
                    \]
                    <p>
                    Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the process \( (W_t^{(n)})_{t \ge 0} \) converges in distribution to a standard Brownian motion \( (B_t)_{t \ge 0} \). We write this convergence formally as:
                    </p>
                    \[

                    Here, \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \). The convergence \( \xrightarrow{d} \) means convergence in distribution in the space of continuous functions \( C([0, \infty), \R) \) equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on compact intervals.

                    The scaling factors are crucial: time is scaled by \( n \) (we look at time \( nt \)) and space is scaled by \( \sqrt{n} \). The \( \sqrt{n} \) scaling comes from the Central Limit Theorem, as the variance of \( S_k \) is \( k \), so the standard deviation is \( \sqrt{k} \). For \( k \approx nt \), the standard deviation is \( \approx \sqrt{nt} \), and scaling by \( 1/\sqrt{n} \) gives a standard deviation of \( \approx \sqrt{t} \), matching the variance \( t \) of \( B_t \).

                     <h3>3.1 Definition of the Ito Integral</h3>
                     <p>
                     Since Brownian paths are nowhere differentiable, standard Riemann or even Riemann-Stieltjes integration theory does not allow us to define an integral like " \( \int f(t) \diff B_t \) " in the usual way. The Ito integral provides a way to define integrals with respect to Brownian motion.
                     </p>
                    <p>
                        Let \( (B_t)_{t \ge 0} \) be a standard Brownian motion. We want to define the integral of a stochastic process \( (H_s)_{s \ge 0} \) with respect to \( B_t \), denoted \( \int_0^t H_s \diff B_s \). The process \( H_s \) is called the integrand. For the Ito integral to be well-defined, \( H_s \) typically needs to be "adapted" (meaning \( H_s \) only depends on the history of \( B_u \) for \( u \le s \)) and satisfy some integrability conditions (e.g., \( \E[\int_0^t H_s^2 \diff s] < \infty \)).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consider a partition of the interval \( [0, t] \) into \( n \) subintervals: \( 0 = t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_n = t \). A common choice is \( t_i = it/n \). The Ito integral is defined as a limit in probability (or in the mean-square sense) of approximating sums:
                    </p>
                    \[
                    \int_{0}^{t} H_s \diff B_s = \lim_{\|\mathcal{P}\| \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} H_{t_i} (B_{t_{i+1}} - B_{t_i}).
                    \]
                    <p>
                        where the limit is taken as the mesh of the partition \( \|\mathcal{P}\| = \max_i |t_{i+1} - t_i| \to 0 \).

                        Crucially, the integrand \( H_{t_i} \) is evaluated at the <strong>left endpoint</strong> of the interval \( [t_i, t_{i+1}] \). This choice is essential and distinguishes the Ito integral from other types of stochastic integrals (like the Stratonovich integral, which uses the midpoint). This choice ensures that the resulting integral process is a martingale under suitable conditions on \( H \).

                    </p>
                    \[

                    <h3>4.1 Definition via Stochastic Integrals</h3>
                    <p>
                        Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) are differential equations that involve random noise terms, typically modeled using Brownian motion. They are used to model systems that evolve randomly over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An SDE describes the evolution of a stochastic process \( (X_t)_{t \ge 0} \). A general form of a one-dimensional SDE is written in differential notation as:
                    </p>
                    \[
                    \diff X_t = a(t, X_t) \diff t + b(t, X_t) \diff B_t
                    \]
                    <p>
                        where \( (B_t)_{t \ge 0} \) is a standard Brownian motion, and \( a(t, x) \) and \( b(t, x) \) are functions called the <strong>drift coefficient</strong> and <strong>diffusion coefficient</strong>, respectively. They determine the deterministic and random parts of the change in \( X_t \) over a small time interval \( \diff t \).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This differential notation is a shorthand for the corresponding integral equation:
                    </p>
                    \[
                    X_t = X_0 + \int_0^t a(s, X_s) \diff s + \int_0^t b(s, X_s) \diff B_s
                    \]
                    <p>
                        Here, \( X_0 \) is the initial condition (which might be random but independent of \( (B_s)_{s>0} \) and measurable with respect to the information at time 0). The first integral \( \int_0^t a(s, X_s) \diff s \) is a standard pathwise Riemann integral (once the path \( X_s \) is known), while the second integral \( \int_0^t b(s, X_s) \diff B_s \) is an Ito integral.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A process \( (X_t)_{t \ge 0} \) is called a <strong>solution</strong> to the SDE if it satisfies this integral equation (and is adapted). Under certain conditions on the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) (typically Lipschitz continuity and linear growth conditions), there exists a unique strong solution \( X_t \).

                    <h3>5.1 Comparison with Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</h3>
                     <p>
                         Ito's formula is the fundamental theorem of stochastic calculus. It is the chain rule for functions of stochastic processes that follow an SDE involving an Ito integral. It differs from the standard chain rule in calculus due to the non-zero quadratic variation of Brownian motion.
                     </p>
                    <p>
                        Recall the fundamental theorem of calculus and the chain rule. If \( x(t) \) is a continuously differentiable function and \( f(x) \) is a continuously differentiable function, then \( y(t) = f(x(t)) \) is also differentiable, and its derivative is given by the chain rule:
                    </p>
                    \[ \frac{\diff y}{\diff t} = f'(x(t)) \frac{\diff x}{\diff t} \]
                    <p>
                    In differential form: \( \diff y = f'(x) \diff x \).
                    Integrating this gives the change-of-variable formula for integrals:
                    </p>
                    \[ f(x(t)) - f(x(0)) = \int_0^t f'(x(s)) \diff x(s) = \int_0^t f'(x(s)) x'(s) \diff s \]
                    <p>
                    This relies on \( x(t) \) being smooth enough (having finite variation). However, processes like \( X_t \) driven by \( B_t \) have paths of infinite variation and are not differentiable, so the standard rules do not apply.

                    <h3>5.2 Statement of Ito's Formula</h3>
                    <p>
                        Let \( (X_t)_{t \ge 0} \) be an Ito process, meaning it solves an SDE of the form:
                    </p>
                    \[ \diff X_t = a_t \diff t + b_t \diff B_t \]
                    <p>
                        where \( a_t = a(t, X_t) \) and \( b_t = b(t, X_t) \) are adapted processes satisfying appropriate integrability conditions. Let \( f(t, x) \) be a function that is continuously differentiable in \( t \) and twice continuously differentiable in \( x \) (i.e., \( f \in C^{1,2}([0, \infty) \times \R) \)). Then the process \( Y_t = f(t, X_t) \) is also an Ito process, and its differential is given by <strong>Ito's formula</strong>:
                    </p>
                    \[
                    \diff Y_t = \diff f(t, X_t) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(t, X_t) \diff t + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(t, X_t) \diff X_t + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}(t, X_t) (\diff X_t)^2
                    \]
                    <p>
                        Here, \( (\diff X_t)^2 \) needs to be interpreted using the "rules" of stochastic differentials (often called Ito's multiplication rules or heuristic rules):
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>\( (\diff t)^2 = 0 \)</li>
                        <li>\( \diff t \diff B_t = 0 \)</li>
                        <li>\( (\diff B_t)^2 = \diff t \)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    These rules arise from the limiting behavior of sums of squares and cross-products of increments. Using these rules, we find the quadratic variation term:
                    </p>
                    \[ (\diff X_t)^2 = (a_t \diff t + b_t \diff B_t)^2 = a_t^2 (\diff t)^2 + 2 a_t b_t \diff t \diff B_t + b_t^2 (\diff B_t)^2 = 0 + 0 + b_t^2 \diff t = b_t^2 \diff t. \]
                    <p>
                    Substituting \( \diff X_t = a_t \diff t + b_t \diff B_t \) and \( (\diff X_t)^2 = b_t^2 \diff t \) into the formula for \( \diff Y_t \), we get the standard form of Ito's formula:
                    </p>
                    \[
                    \diff f(t, X_t) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + a_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2} b_t^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \right) \diff t + b_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \diff B_t
                    \]
                    <p>
                    where all partial derivatives are evaluated at \( (t, X_t) \).

                    <p>
                    The integral form is:
                    </p>
                    \[
                    f(t, X_t) - f(0, X_0) = \int_0^t \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial s}(s, X_s) + a_s \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(s, X_s) + \frac{1}{2} b_s^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}(s, X_s) \right) \diff s + \int_0^t b_s \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(s, X_s) \diff B_s

                         Compare this to the standard chain rule \( \diff f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \diff t + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \diff X_t \). Ito's formula includes an additional term: \( \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} (\diff X_t)^2 \rightarrow \frac{1}{2} b_t^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \diff t \). This is often called the "Ito correction term" and arises because the quadratic variation of the process \( X_t \) (due to the \( \diff B_t \) term) is non-zero and proportional to \( \diff t \). Specifically, \( (\diff B_t)^2 \) behaves like \( \diff t \), not like \( (\diff t)^2 \) which is negligible in standard calculus.

                         Let \( X_t = B_t \). Then \( a_t = 0 \) and \( b_t = 1 \). Let \( f(t, x) = f(x) = x^2/2 \). We have \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = 0 \), \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = x \), \( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = 1 \).
                         Applying Ito's formula to \( Y_t = f(B_t) = B_t^2/2 \):
                         </p>
                         \[
                         \diff (B_t^2/2) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + a_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2} b_t^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \right) \diff t + b_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \diff B_t
                         \]
                         \[
                         \diff (B_t^2/2) = \left( 0 + 0 \cdot B_t + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 \right) \diff t + (1 \cdot B_t) \diff B_t
                         \]
                         \[
                         \diff (B_t^2/2) = \frac{1}{2} \diff t + B_t \diff B_t
                         \]
                         <p>Rearranging gives \( B_t \diff B_t = \diff (B_t^2/2) - \frac{1}{2} \diff t \). Integrating from 0 to \( t \) yields:</p>
                         \[
                         \int_0^t B_s \diff B_s = \int_0^t \diff (B_s^2/2) - \int_0^t \frac{1}{2} \diff s = \left[ \frac{B_s^2}{2} \right]_0^t - \frac{1}{2} [s]_0^t = \frac{B_t^2}{2} - \frac{t}{2}
                         \]
                         <p>(since \( B_0 = 0 \)). This confirms the earlier example.</p>

                     <h3>5.3 Sketch of the Proof of Ito's Formula</h3>
                     <p>
                        The rigorous proof involves careful analysis of the convergence of approximating sums for the stochastic integral, often using properties of quadratic variation. Here's a heuristic sketch based on Taylor expansion:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consider the change in \( Y_t = f(t, X_t) \) over a small interval \( [t, t+\Delta t] \):
                        \( \Delta Y = f(t+\Delta t, X_{t+\Delta t}) - f(t, X_t) \).
                        Use Taylor expansion for \( f \) around \( (t, X_t) \) up to second order in \( x \) and first order in \( t \):
                    </p>
                    \[
                    \Delta Y \approx \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \Delta t + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \Delta X + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} (\Delta X)^2 + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t \partial x} \Delta t \Delta X + \dots
                    \]
                    <p>(where partial derivatives are evaluated at \( (t, X_t) \)).</p>
                    <p>Now, approximate the increment \( \Delta X = X_{t+\Delta t} - X_t \) using the SDE:</p>
                    \[ \Delta X \approx a_t \Delta t + b_t \Delta B_t, \]
                    <p>where \( \Delta B_t = B_{t+\Delta t} - B_t \).</p>
                    <p>Next, consider the quadratic terms involving \( \Delta X \):</p>
                    \[ (\Delta X)^2 \approx (a_t \Delta t + b_t \Delta B_t)^2 = a_t^2 (\Delta t)^2 + 2 a_t b_t \Delta t \Delta B_t + b_t^2 (\Delta B_t)^2 \]
                    \[ \Delta t \Delta X \approx a_t (\Delta t)^2 + b_t \Delta t \Delta B_t \]
                    <p>The key insight from stochastic calculus is about the orders of magnitude for small \( \Delta t \):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>\( \E[\Delta B_t] = 0 \), \( \text{Var}(\Delta B_t) = \E[(\Delta B_t)^2] = \Delta t \).</li>
                        <li>In a summation over many small intervals, \( \sum (\Delta B_t)^2 \) converges to \( t \). Heuristically, \( (\Delta B_t)^2 \approx \Delta t \).</li>
                        <li>Terms like \( (\Delta t)^2 \), \( \Delta t \Delta B_t \) are of smaller order than \( \Delta t \). Specifically, \( \sum (\Delta t)^2 \to 0 \), \( \sum \Delta t \Delta B_t \to 0 \).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So, keeping terms that are of order \( \Delta t \) or \( \Delta B_t \):</p>
                    \[ (\Delta X)^2 \approx b_t^2 (\Delta B_t)^2 \approx b_t^2 \Delta t \]
                    \[ \Delta t \Delta X \approx 0 \]
                    <p>Substitute these approximations back into the Taylor expansion for \( \Delta Y \):</p>
                    \[
                    \Delta Y \approx \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \Delta t + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} (a_t \Delta t + b_t \Delta B_t) + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} (b_t^2 \Delta t)
                    \]
                    <p>Rearranging gives:</p>
                    \[
                    \Delta Y \approx \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + a_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2} b_t^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \right) \Delta t + b_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \Delta B_t
                    \]
                    <p>Summing these increments over a partition \( 0 = t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_n = t \) and taking the limit as the mesh size goes to zero, the sum of \( \Delta Y_i \) becomes \( f(t, X_t) - f(0, X_0) \). The sum of the \( \Delta t \) terms converges to a Riemann integral, and the sum of the \( \Delta B_t \) terms converges (by definition) to the Ito integral:</p>
                    \[
                    f(t, X_t) - f(0, X_0) = \int_0^t \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial s} + a_s \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2} b_s^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \right) \diff s + \int_0^t b_s \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \diff B_s
                    \]
                    <p>This yields the integral form of Ito's formula. The differential form \( \diff Y_t = \dots \) is a convenient shorthand for this integral equation.</p>
